### Project Description
We are presenting a cinephile chatbot which responds to each prompt with a famous malayalam or tamil movie dialogue. This becomes more fun as we bring voice to the bot, It now speaks the dailogue to us.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The major problem through our vision was productivity and how people use time efficiently.

We sat upside down and came up with our brand new MASS CHAT BOT, which a person can spend hours laughing to our ridiculous on voice replies.

Here we see our UI with core malayalam characters blends in with our base idea. Due to time limitation we had to limit us to this instead of individual characters for their respective dialogues
